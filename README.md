Source files for the codevita contest that I participated in September 2012. 

<h3>List of problems</h3>

<ul><li><div>
<h4>PopOutPrimes</h4>
We need to find the nth prime number in the given list. The range of the numbers is given and the nth prime number in the given list should be calculated.
<br/><i>Constraints:</i>
The range starts from 0 and goes till 1500000(15 lakhs) Any value outside this range is considered invalid and given in that way. Moreover the end of the range should be greater than the beginning of the range.
</div></li>

<li><div>
<h4>ISBN</h4>
ISBN is a standard book number written on products. it consist of 10 digits. The first 9 digits can contain digits from 0-9. The last digit can be 0-9 or X(representing 10).
Uniqueness of the ISBN is as given below in this link Tutorial about ISBN
One of the 10 digits will be marked as "?". Find the value.
</div></li>

<li><div><h4>Numbers Sort</h4>
Sort the numbers in ascending order and descending order. (You can't get as simple as this. lol!)
</div></li>

<li><div><h4>Sum Of Array Elements</h4>
Find the sum of all the elements of the array. (Wait a minute, this is easier than the previous problem. :P)
</div></li>
<li><div>
<h4>Matrix Transpose</h4>
Read the matrix from a file and print its transpose.
<br/><i>Constraints:</i>
Print all the elements of the matrix rounded of to 3 decimal places.
</div></li>
<li><div>
<h4>LoanEMI</h4>
(This is part of the program of the first round. and the program which was given in the first round was again given in our finals)
Calculate the EMI and the total interest after 3 months.
<br/>emi=(L*I)*((1+I)^N)/(((1+I)^N)-1)
<br/>where
<br/>L -> Original Principle
<br/>I -> Rate of interest in years
<br/>N ->Time in years
<br/>All money should be rounded off to 2 decimal places.
<br/>The limit for the principle is 10000000000 (1000 Crores)
<br/>Rate of Interest range: 0-100
<br/>Time range: 1-1188
</div></li>

<h4>Scramble</h4>
You are ralley awemose if you are albe to raed tihs. The haumn biran is traenid in scuh a way taht a prsoen can raed a wrod if the fsirt and the lsat letrets are in the smae pisootin and the oherts are not. In tihs proargm we hvae to sarlcmbe the proargm in scuh a way wtih the geivn ailrthgom.
The position of all the special characters and space should be the same. Do it you are a King!
</div></li>

Some programs that we tried

String reverse program
Remove all the words in a given sentence, reverse each word and give the output. The position of the word in the sentence should not change, neither does the position of the special characters and white spaces.
